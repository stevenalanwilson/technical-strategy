# Technical Strategy Document: Semantic Language & Ontology

This repository provides a structured approach for representing your digital platform strategy as code. By defining a formal ontology and semantic language, you can capture strategic goals, values, targets, and initiatives in machine-readable formats like YAML, JSON, or a custom DSL. This enables validation, automation, and seamless integration with software tools, making your strategy actionable and easy to maintain.

To enable representing your one-page strategy  in code, we will use a **semantic language** (a formal, structured grammar specifying valid expressions and their meaning) and an **ontology** (a defined vocabulary of concepts and their relationships). 

Below is a proposal for both, designed specifically strategy, suitable for YAML/JSON or custom DSL.

## **Draft: Ontology Design**

Here is a rewritten ontology design specification for your strategy document, aligned with the requested format while formally capturing the entities, attributes, and relationships:

## Ontology Design Specification for Strategy Document

### Entities (Classes/Objects)

- `StrategyDocument`  
- `Purpose`  
- `Vision`  
- `CoreValue` (multiple)  
- `Target` (multiple, with `description` and `time_frame`)  
- `AnnualGoal` (multiple, with `description`, `time_frame`, and `OKRs`)  
- `KeyInitiative` (multiple, with `area`, `initiatives`, `time_frame`, and `OKRs`)  
- `BrandPromise`  
- `KPI` (multiple)  
- `MeetingRhythm` (multiple, with `frequency` and `meeting_type`)  

### Attributes for Each Entity

## **How to Use**

- **YAML** or **JSON** can be consumed by software for validation, templating, or display in any app.
- Ontology classes can map directly to database tables or GraphQL types.
- You can create a custom DSL if you want a more human-readable code-language just for this purpose.
