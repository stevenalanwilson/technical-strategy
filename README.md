# Technical Strategy Document: Semantic Language & Ontology

This repository provides a structured approach for representing your digital platform strategy as code. By defining a formal ontology and semantic language, you can capture strategic goals, values, targets, and initiatives in machine-readable formats like YAML, JSON, or a custom DSL. This enables validation, automation, and seamless integration with software tools, making your strategy actionable and easy to maintain.

To enable representing your one-page strategy  in code, we will use a **semantic language** (a formal, structured grammar specifying valid expressions and their meaning) and an **ontology** (a defined vocabulary of concepts and their relationships). 

Below is a proposal for both, designed specifically strategy, suitable for YAML/JSON or custom DSL.

***

## **Draft: Ontology Design**

**Entities (Classes/Objects):**
- `StrategyDocument`
- `Purpose`
- `Vision`
- `CoreValue` (multiple)
- `Target` (multiple, with `description` and `time_frame`)
- `AnnualGoal` (multiple)
- `KeyInitiative` (multiple, with `area` and `initiatives`)
- `BrandPromise`
- `KPI` (multiple)
- `MeetingRhythm` (multiple, with `frequency` and `meeting_type`)

**Relationships:**
- `StrategyDocument` *has one* `Purpose`, `Vision`, `BrandPromise`
- `StrategyDocument` *has many* `CoreValue`, `Target`, `AnnualGoal`, `KeyInitiative`, `KPI`, `MeetingRhythm`
- `KeyInitiative` *has one* `area` and *has many* `initiatives`

***

## **Semantic Language (Example via YAML Syntax)**

```yaml
strategy_document:
  purpose: >
    Empower users and partners by delivering seamless digital experiences that enable growth, efficiency, and innovation.
  vision: >
    To be the leading digital platform in our sector, recognized for simplicity, trust, and scale by 2027.
  core_values:
    - Customer obsession
    - Relentless improvement
    - Openness & collaboration
    - Data-driven decisions
    - High accountability
  targets:
    - description: 3,000,000 active users
      time_frame: 3-5 years
    - description: 98% customer satisfaction
      time_frame: 3-5 years
    - description: $50M annual recurring revenue
      time_frame: 3-5 years
    - description: Platform uptime: 99.99%
      time_frame: 3-5 years
  annual_goals:
    - Double monthly active users
    - Launch 2 key integrations with major industry partners
    - Improve Net Promoter Score (NPS) to 70
    - Reduce average incident response time by 40%
  key_initiatives:
    - area: Product
      initiatives:
        - Re-platform for scalability
        - Roll out advanced analytics dashboard
    - area: Marketing & Growth
      initiatives:
        - Launch referral program
        - Co-market with top 3 industry partners
    - area: Operations
      initiatives:
        - Automate onboarding
        - Implement real-time monitoring
    - area: People
      initiatives:
        - Invest in agile training
        - Quarterly team alignment days
  brand_promise: >
    Effortless connection and actionable insightsâ€”every login, every time.
  kpis:
    - Weekly active users
    - Uptime & response speed
    - Customer satisfaction score
    - Partner engagement rate
    - Roadmap milestone completion percentage
  meeting_rhythms:
    - frequency: Daily
      meeting_type: 10-min standup
    - frequency: Weekly
      meeting_type: Progress & priorities
    - frequency: Monthly
      meeting_type: Metrics review
    - frequency: Quarterly
      meeting_type: Strategic review
    - frequency: Annually
      meeting_type: Deep-dive planning
```

## **How to Use**

- **YAML** or **JSON** can be consumed by software for validation, templating, or display in any app.
- Ontology classes can map directly to database tables or GraphQL types.
- You can create a custom DSL if you want a more human-readable code-language just for this purpose.

***

## **Custom Mini-DSL Example**

If you prefer an even more natural-language DSL:

```yaml
StrategyDocument
  Purpose: "Empower users and partners..."
  Vision: "To be the leading digital platform..."
  CoreValues: ["Customer obsession", "Relentless improvement", ...]
  Targets:
    - "3,000,000 active users" over "3-5 years"
    - "98% customer satisfaction" over "3-5 years"
  AnnualGoals: ["Double monthly active users", ...]
  KeyInitiatives:
    Product: ["Re-platform for scalability", ...]
    MarketingGrowth: ["Launch referral program", ...]
  BrandPromise: "Effortless connection..."
  KPIs: ["Weekly active users", ...]
  MeetingRhythms:
    Daily: "10-min standup"
    Weekly: "Progress & priorities"
    ...
End
```

***

## **Summary**

- The **ontology** defines your digital platform strategy's parts and relationships.
- The **semantic language** lets you represent and code those parts in YAML, JSON, or a DSL.
- This enables programmatic editing, validation, publication, or automation of the strategy doc.
